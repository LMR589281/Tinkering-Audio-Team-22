Link to our GitHub repository:<br />
https://github.com/LMR589281/Tinkering-Audio-Team-22

What you need to run our project:<br />
Unity with version 2018.4.2f1, as well as a monitor or a headset capable of outputting sound

License:<br />
We have chosen to use the unlicensed license, as we don't wish to profit of the scripts we have made or adapted, but we also don't want to stop others from using our work for education, profit or modification.
We want others to be able to use and read our scripts to help them understand more about tinkering audio through scripts. 
We have chosen this licence over other similar licenses such as the MIT license because the unlicensed does not need any conditions while the MIT license does need a license and copyright notice,
which is better when you want to keep more ownership over your work.
